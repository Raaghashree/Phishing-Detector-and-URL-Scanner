# Phishing-Detector-and-URL-Scanner

Phishing attacks pose a significant cybersecurity threat, frequently exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive emails and malicious links. This project presents a phishing detection tool designed to analyze both user-submitted and real-time fetched email content and URLs to identify potential phishing threats. By utilizing a fine-tuned BERT-based NLP model, the system assesses the probability of phishing in the text, while an external security API (like VirusTotal) evaluates URLs for any malicious activity. The Tkinter-based GUI enables users to enter suspicious emails or fetch emails in real-time via an API, offering prompt risk assessments and insights into possible threats. This combined approach boosts cybersecurity awareness and helps individuals effectively recognize phishing attempts.
